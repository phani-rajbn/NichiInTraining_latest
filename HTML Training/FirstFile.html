<h1>What is Web Application?</h1>
<p>
An Application that can run on a thin software called Browser. This is installed on every electronic gadget.  If a data(information) has to be shared among the users, U dont need an additional software. Web Apps have high reachability over its other counter parts. 
Web Apps are developed as Web Pages, a collection of HTML files.   </p>
<p>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the simplest of presenting formatted text to the users. It uses markups or tags to format the content of the Text in a presentable manner. 
HTML is static content. The content will be not modifyable without refreshing the Page in the browser. 
</p>
<p>
Most of the content that U present will be static, exception of a few parts of certain Pages. Those few parts are dynamically generated using the HTML' s DOM(Document object Model) structure. We use Scripting Languauge to dynamically generate the content which reflects on the page. Examples of Scripting languages are Javascript, VBScript and Perl. Of these langauges, Javascript is the popular scripting language as it is recommended by all the browsers and an Organization for Web Stds called as W3C.(World Wide Web Consortium)

<h2>Where to store these pages?</h2>
We can store the web pages on any kind of a place where it can be accessible. If U want it to be viewed by multiple users at different locations, we could place it inside a machine that contain a software called Web server. A Web server is a software for getting the page from a repository of files and giving it to the Requested user using std protocols like HTTP or FTP. 
Examples of Web server are IIS, Apache Tomcat, NodeJs, WAMP and other PHP related server. Web Apps that are built on Windows and .NET Technology use IIS(Internet Information Services).

	NOTE: U can still store the web pages in a file system and view them thro the Browser directly if U have access to those directories. This does not need any web server. They are viewed local to that machine.

<h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
<p>
	To transfer the content from one machine to another machine, networks use protocols to share the files or the data. <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> is a stateless protocol used to transfer text based files. Hyper Text is a text format in a linear fashion where the content is viewable on a line by line format. HTTP is used to transfer the files(Hyper Text) from the location(Server) to the destination which is called as Client Machine(Browser machine).

<h2>What is a markup language</h2>
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in the way that it is syntactically distinguishable from the Text.  The decorations that U make for emphasizing the Text is called as Markups. Eg: Heading&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and many more...
Markups also include Formatted text, aligned content, Listings, Anchors, Tables, Framesets and Forms.
