		<h3>Contents of an HTML Page</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
			<li>Any html page will have a doctype that called as Prelude which tells that its an HTML5 Document.</li>
			<li>It has 2 parts: head and body.</li>
			<li>The head segment will contain the data(Meta information) about the Page like Author, Created Date, Content type, Source, Keywords for the search engine.

		<h3>Textual Formats for the body</h3>
		<p>Content in the text can be done in 2 ways. HTML 4.0 gave certain attrbutes and Tags to make the content formattable. Now its recommended to use CSS for applying the required formats. But still Web Apps use inline tags for formatting small amounts of content specific to that page. 
			<p>The Important ones are:</p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>&lt;b&gt; Used for <b>Bold</b> text to draw the attention</li>
				<li>&lt;i&gt; Used for <i>Italics</i> text to emphasize the content</li>
				<li>&lt;strike&gt; Used for <strike>Strike</strike> text to strike the content</li>
				<li>&lt;u&gt; Used for <u>underline</u> text to draw the attention and mark for a significance</li>
			</ol>
	</div>

		<abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> output is based on the browser U work with. So all browsers dont have support for all the features. Each browser might interpret the content in its own way. Most of the features are available for all the browsers, except certain advanced enhancements and features. 
		<i><u>NOTE</u>: Refer the mozilla documentation for further Formatting markups.</i>
