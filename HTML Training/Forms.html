	<h1>User registration Form</h1>
	<p>
		Users can interact by providing details for any input features that has to be stored in an external database or any file system. This is done using the HTML forms. Forms usually work with server side or client side code with interaction happening thro services(REST or Web services). Many Scripting languages dont provide IO operations. U cannot do any file operations or database operations. These features are provided by the server side scripting technology and Client side simply consumes those services and place them in the HTML pages....
	</p>
	<p><cite>NOTE: To work with only the client side, U could use local storage of the HTML5. In HTML5, we could store text based data in the form key-value pairs in the browser. This is called as local Storage. The data is not available for all the users, it is only for the current user who consumes that application inside the browser. </cite></p>
	<p>There is a new control called datalist which allows to store some data in the form of text. The datalist will have an id which will be refered by any input element so that when inputs are given to that element, it could filter the data from the datalist and select an item from it. It is similar to dropdownlist but with editable feature. In select, U cannot select any new item other than found in the options of the select. But in an input control associated with datalist, if the entry is not found in the datalist, U could make a new entry and allow the user to take that as the input value. </p>
